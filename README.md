# Meet-App

## Description

The objective of this project is to build a serverless, progressive web application with React using a test-driven development technique. The application uses the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events. Users will be able to filter events by city, show/hide event details, specify the number of events shown, use the app offline, add an app shortcut to the home screen, and view a chart showing the number of upcoming events by city. 

## Key Features

* Feature 1: Filter events by city 
 
    Filter events by city so that a list of events that take place in that particular city is displayed.

* Feature 3: Specify number of events 

    Specify the number of events displayed at one time so that more or less events are displayed in the events list at one time. 

* Feature 4: Use the app offline 

    Use the app while offline and be able see the events viewed the last time the user was online.

* Feature 5: Data visualization 

    See a chart showing the upcoming events in each city so that users see which cities have upcoming events. 

* Feature 6: Add an app shortcut to the home screen 

    Add an app shortcut to the home screen so that access to the app is faster and more convenient.
